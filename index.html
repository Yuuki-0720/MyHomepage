        <p class="title">My very first application has been released!</p>
        <p>
            The time has come. I have wanted to release my application on the AppStore since I was a JHS student. Now I released my very first game application for smartphones. But you would wonder why you chose a game? Because when I was a member of the high school's computer club, the same year club president told me that "Hey, Hyodo. You should make a 3d game for the school festival this year." Though I wanted to study Objective-C and Xcode at that time, I reluctantly accepted his order and started using Unity 4 and C#. Looking back, it was a great decision. I like making fun of my friends better than developing tools. "Legend Pilot" is my culmination of what I learned ever until now. Please download on the AppStore for free and enjoy the game.
